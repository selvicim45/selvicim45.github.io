						   My Name is Arulselvi Amirrthalingam (Selvi) and I am a student of this college for more than 1 year.
						   I am a Computer Engineering graduate. I love learning latest technologies. I am currently looking for
                           Job opportunities in the Information Technology (IT) field. My hobbies are painting, dancing.
                           I also like to cook. I never attended any online classes before, this is my first attempt.

						   I am attending this class because, I want to write the mobile applications. I want to learn latest
                           technologies, so I can add  value to my resume. I want to land in a good job in information technology.
